Depends on:
python3
pyqt
python-qscintilla

To install (it's not necessary), run "./setup.py install" as root.
You can run asc-cli for CLI or asc-qt for GUI.

If you want pks syntax highlighting in vim, you can copy utils/pks.vim to
$HOME/.vim/syntax/, and add the following line to your .vimrc:
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.pks set filetype=pks

Most of the command's information was taken from PKSV's pokedef.h (Thanks!)
