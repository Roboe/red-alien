Depends on:
python3
pyqt
python-qscintilla

You can run asc.py for CLI or asc_gui_qt.py for GUI.

If you want pks syntax highlighting in vim, you can copy utils/pks.vim to
~/.vim/syntax/, and add the following line to your .vimrc:
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.pks set filetype=pks



Most of the command's information was taken from PKSV's pokedef.h
