= The Red Alien Pokémon Script Compiler

This is the source repository for [Red Alien], a
compiler for the scripting system found in GBA Pokémon games.

See the [documentation] and [examples] for an overview of its
features.

== Running

Red Alien is built using cross-platform technologies, so it should run
everywhere. I build [windows binaries] every now and again.

[windows binaries]: http://www.cosarara.me/redalien/#windows

Red alien is written in python and can be run directly from the
source files if you have all the dependencies installed:

* python3
* pyqt
* python-qscintilla

It can be installed system-wide (although it's not needed):

    # ./setup.py install

You can run asc-cli for CLI or asc-qt for the GUI.

If you want pks syntax highlighting in vim, you can copy utils/pks.vim to
$HOME/.vim/syntax/, and add the following line to your .vimrc:
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.pks set filetype=pks

== Acknowledgements

Most of the command's information was taken from PKSV's pokedef.h (Thanks!)

The headers in stdlib/ are taken from XSE.
