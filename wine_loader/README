So well, I made this little hack/workaround to make it posible to integrate AM running in wine
with the native ASC. I know, you could use ASC running in wine as well, but that's not cool.
So well, just choose this loader.exe in script editor selection in AM, choose No when asked a
question (obviously, who in hell would use ";"?), and that's it.
Oh, and if you make any changes to the source .c file, you can recompile from linux using
$ i486-mingw32-gcc -Wall loader.c
(you'll need mingw32-gcc, of course)
